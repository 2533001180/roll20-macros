"Greetings Chokot," said the huntress affably, looking up from her plate to examine the reptilian stranger.  

*The hood of her squirrel pelt jacket slump down against her shoulder length auburn hair.  Her smile was genuine as meeting new people was something she enjoyed, and immediately beckoned him to join her.  A young tavern boy, Rendel, noticed Sliver Brook's subtle gesture for another bottle of the lilac wine and an additioanl glass.  The first glass was poured.  The fire was crakling with new life after several small logs had been added to the waning embers.  Barnaby's snoring had become much less distracting.*

"Please join me for a glass or two, while I share a little of what I know."

*Nothing was more satisfying for Silver Brook than gossiping after a very long hunting trip.*

"Upon my return to Norburg I learned that Barnaby escorted a group of dwarves to the site of a new travel gate to ignite it.  It's meant to allow faster trade between Norburg and the Dwarves of The Kinder Peaks.  All went well, apparently, until they returned to Norburg through the 'Travel Gate'."  She made a dismissive sound with sputtering lips.  "I like to take life on foot, you know?  To breath the fresh air and feel the ground beneath my feet.  The gate is a rare hybrid of machine and magic they say, but I see it as a gaudy and expensive short cut."

*Stopping to take a drink, it was obvious she was enjoying telling Chokot about her lifestyle.*

"It has been said that the portal wizard who did the enchanting made a mistake of some kind and caused the deaths of an escort of dwarves charged with protecting him as they passed through the gate.  It seems they may have been pursued by a number of orcs, but once on the other side, Balthazar the Portal Mage closed the gate just in time."

*She leaned conspiratorially near Chokot for emphasis and a semblance of privacy.*

"Barnaby hasn't been himself ever since.  If you ask me, I think that gate changes people, and I for one will stick to the old roads.  He even dropped a barrel of gar on the docks recently! Unbelieveable!"
